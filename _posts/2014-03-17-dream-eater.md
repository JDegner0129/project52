People have some really weird dreams. I, personally, don't remember a whole lot of mine - but I do have tons of friends who will tell me "man, I had the WEIRDEST dream last night!" I'd be really surprised if dreams were just completely random (and I'm *sure* there's some amount of research somewhere showing that they're not), and I'm really curious to know what kinds of things affect the dreams you have. Life events that leave impressions on your memory probably have something to do with them, your mood when going to bed probably has something to do with them ... The list goes on.

So, what if there were a platform where people could write down the events of their day, and then have some device analyze their dreams while they sleep and make analogs between real life and the dream? Given a wide enough user base, this could be a really cool experiment, and I'm sure people would get some amount of value out of it. "Your dreams indicate that you've been put under a high amount of stress," etc. It could do comparative analysis: two people with similar lifestyles and dream patterns might be considered compatible poeple, OR two people who are involved with each others' lives could be evaluated on more of a group scale. Evaluating dreams based on how a *group* of people thinks and interacts would be pretty sweet.

Even better, if people were comfortable with it, maybe they wouldn't even have to write down their daily events in a diary - the device used for monitoring brainwaves during sleep could also be used to do the same thing during periods of awakeness. Well, provided it didn't make them look like they were wearing some weird headgear, I guess. In any case, it could be pretty interesting! It'd probably be a great way to make progress in the analysis of dreams. This doesn't seem hugely feasible right now - or at least not in an attractive/cheap way - and I'm not sure people would be willing to give all that information to a host system, but if it's **just** looking at brainwaves, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

Of course, I'm writing this after taking a dose of NyQuil. What a coincidence.
