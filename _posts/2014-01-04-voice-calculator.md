Using a calculator can be really annoying - it shouldn't take 15+ button presses just to get a basic idea like a graph across. They're one of those interesting pieces of hardware where the hardware itself is the limitation to your throughput with it. What if I could just ... tell it what to do? That makes a lot more sense in a lot of cases. "Tell me the integral of x cubed from zero to fifty." Wow, that was easy.

Now, that said, it stops getting easy when you become a computational physicist and need to express fairly complex formulae with your voice. A voice-operated calculator could get tricky pretty easily, but maybe that's just because we've been trained not to be able to express those formulae verbally by the calculators we already use. Maybe it could be a revolution. God damn.
