Sorry for the late post! I got caught up doing a whole lot of nothing this weekend and forgot about posting a new idea (even though I came up with this one on Friday!). Anyway. I was thinking about the fact that I have so many different cards in my wallet. They're incredibly obnoxious. I've got probably five or six different cards that allow me to get into different places and do different things - what if it were just one? Now, I *know* this idea exists within the space of [card-based payment](https://www.simple.com). But where I *don't* know that it exists is within the space of card authorization; if I need to get into my dorm, I have to scan a card. If I need to get into my work office, I have to scan a card. You get the picture. Wouldn't it be great if, instead of being given multiple cards, doors could have scanners that recognize a universal card that can have multiple identifiers *registered* to it?

You could also, of course, register these IDs onto some smartphone/tablet application and allow something onscreen to be scanned by a device. Or use a smartphone's NFC capabilities to transfer information about each identifier at-will. There are plenty of ways to go about transferring authorizing information (and payments, too!), but it all boils to this: wallets are pretty old-school. I shouldn't really need hard cash for, well, almost anything. And if I don't need cash in my wallet, I'd really love a way to get rid of everything else, too. The best part about the possibility of paperless payment using an app is the possibility of two-way communication that could enable the device to simply archive receipts, rather than having to use printouts or bank-dependent online banking technology. This would allow for services like [Mint](https://www.mint.com) to more easily provide analytics on your spending habits, freeze your application once you hit a certain spending limit, and more.

Maybe this is just my way of telling myself I spend way too much money ... who knows.
