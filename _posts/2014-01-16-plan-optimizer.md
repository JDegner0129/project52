One of the hardest parts of getting dinner with people, or figuring out what to do for the night, is that my friends and I have *so much trouble deciding*. I don't know why, but it seems like every single group of people I'm with manages to take an unreasonable amount of time to come to a decision. How's it so hard? Take a vote! Oh, but what if it's a tie? Damn. If only there were some way of solving that problem ...

Oh wait, there totally is. If you're a computer science or math person, you probably know about [optimization problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). They're pretty much exactly what they sound like: you pick the most attractive solution to a problem out of the set of feasible solutions. Now, *what* makes a solution attractive is the biggest problem with this idea. Do we want to make the highest amount of people completely happy? Or do we want to have the highest amount of average happiness between all of the people? Whatever the algorithm may be, the premise of this idea is that you employ some sort of algorithm that takes you and your friends' preferences about a set of restaurants, a set of evening activities, or *pretty much anything*, and calculates which of the options should be taken. It's pretty much a nerdier way of voting. What's not to love?
