First things first: sorry for the delay in my posts! It's been a really busy couple of weeks; I've had two exams and four concerts to go to, along with the usual work and school, so I've been spread thin on time to think up new software ideas. Hopefully it doesn't happen again - I'll be catching up this weekend, so you should have two more new posts from me by tomorrow night. Anyway, here goes:

Trying to find a concert to go to can suck. There have been so many incidents recently in which I've wanted to go to a concert, but I don't really know which one or where. All I know is *when*. Basically, spring break is quickly approaching and I'm trying to find a place to roadtrip. I don't really care where I go - I've been to so few places in the US that I'd appreciate going to most decently-sized cities. But, since it's constrained to spring break, I clearly know the timeframe I'm looking to travel within. So ... this sounds a little similar to one of my earlier posts, but wouldn't it be cool if I could just give some program a list of bands and a timeframe, and have it spit out shows that I could potentially attend (with ticket-buying links and everything, of course)?

Obviously, this has a pretty heavy dependence on two things. First, it has dependence on the quality/scrapability of the websites for the user's artists of interest. If a band doesn't have a well-formed website (or doesn't have a website at all!), it'll be pretty hard for this service to provide accurate tour dates for the band, if it can provide any at all. And second, it has dependence on the bands the user provides. As an alternative, though, it'd also be cool to be able to *not* specify any bands and have the service provide you with as many tour dates and locations within the provided timeframe. This would make things much, much harder, as the service would have to have some sort of lookup of as many bands as possible, but it would also make it a much cooler and more expansive service.
