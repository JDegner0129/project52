I've been talking to friends a lot lately about how difficult it can be to learn how to code properly in different languages and frameworks. One of the best ways to see how the pros go about doing their thing with code is to look at their open source projects. And one of the best ways to get better at software development in different frameworks is to contribute to those open source projects. But, searching for an open source project that fits the bill can be challenging. Sure, you can use GitHub's (pretty awesome) search to look for repositories that satisfy certain criteria. "Hey, show me all the Python repositories" or "hey, show me all the repositories with at least 100 forks" are two different ways you can query against GitHub's API. But what if I want to query across repositories on GitHub, Bitbucket, and other hosts?

It would be awesome to have a website that could take a query with different keywords for programming languages, technologies, and general project types - let's say I want a web project that uses Python and RequireJS; I could query this website with "Python RequireJS Django" or "Python RequireJS web" and find issues in open source projects on GitHub, and the like with those qualities that I could contribute to. That way, I could go from wanting to learn a technology, to instantly being able to make an impact on a project using it. And let's not forget that contributions to the open-source community look good! Even people who are pretty familiar with coding can have a hard time contributing to libraries, and this kind of website would be a great place to start.

Oh, by the way, this is a project I think I'm *actually* going to work on. If you want to check it out, you can find it [here](https://github.com/JDegner0129/gindex)!
