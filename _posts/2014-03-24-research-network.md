Alright, so the title is a bit lame. I don't know what I'd call this thing. Research [isn't really sexy](http://drkarendill.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/sexy-research-quarterly-cover.jpg). But I'm just sitting here thinking, "man, why is it so much work to read research papers?" It'd be really nice if it weren't. If I could just kind of casually browse through research in a topic area of my choosing, or in a random intersection of topics, that'd make keeping up with my field (or someone else's) a lot less painful.

Really, this shouldn't even be that hard. There are plenty of websites that have a public listing of research publications. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com), for instance, is like Google ... but, of course, for research articles and patents. I'm *sure* there are at least a few research APIs that could be used for finding data. What I want is a really simple, really passive source of research info. I'm imagining an RSS feed of abstracts that let me click on them for more info. I don't need anything fancy, like some network of research papers and all their authors and all the publishing institutions and blah blah blah. Just give me the skinny on what kind of stuff is being studied in a variety of fields, and that's good enough for me. Basically, I want an app that should treat me like an idiot in the way it presents its information.

Actually, typing that sentence made me think of something else: maybe it could treat me like an idiot in the fields I *don't* specialize in (I could specify), but give me more details for articles in the fields I *do* specialize in. That'd be pretty nifty.
