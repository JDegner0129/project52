Calendars are really helpful. They organize your whole life and tell you when you need to do things. What's not to like about them, right? Well, they suffer from one pretty crippling limitation - they're only as helpful as we make them. Really, a calendar does nothing more than *remind* you that you need to do something. Everything it tells you is nothing more than something you thought yourself at some point. Which is still nice, but it also means a calendar isn't anywhere near as useful as it could be.

But then I thought about another neat little organizational tool for all you devs out there: [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). JIRA lets you attribute "story points" to everything you set out to do, as a way of telling your fellow devs and PMs how much time and effort each thing is going to take. Then, you can see how well you're "burning down" your story points and accomplishing things every release. You can probably figure out where this is going ... basically, why don't we do the same thing in our calendars? A JIRA for life. Wouldn't that be cool? 

Every time you make an event on your calendar, you put in its start and end time, and rank its importance/complexity by giving it story points. Then, not only can your calendar *remind* you of things you need to do - it can *suggest* things that you should do! If you've got an hour of free time and you don't know what to do with it, your calendar could suggest that you start reading that assignment for class that's going to take a few days to get through. The obvious downfall of this kind of calendar is that it totally depends on your story point estimations to provide you meaningful suggestions. But, hey, we can do a bit of hand waving, say "machine learning", and assume that an app like this could "learn" how long it takes for you to do things and make more intelligent suggestions.
